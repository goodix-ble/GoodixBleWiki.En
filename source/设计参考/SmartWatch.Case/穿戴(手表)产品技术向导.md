##### 1.4.2 GR5525 vs GR551x

Description of main upgrades of GR5525 relative to GR551x at the bandwidth level:

1.  The system frequency is increased from 64 MHz to 96 MHz.
2.  The QSPI maximum frequency is increased from 32 MHz to 48 MHz, and the bus architecture is increased from APB to AHB, increasing the bus access speed.
3.  QSPI adds MMAP access mode to support direct bus addressing of NOR Flash and QSPI PSRAM.
4.  The QSPI FIFO depth is increased from 8 to 16/32, and the DMA FIFO is also increased from 8 to 32, which improves the transfer efficiency of DMA.
5.  The number of QSPIs is increased to 3, the number of DMAs is increased to 2, and more QSPI interface peripherals can be expanded as needed.

Based on the above upgrade, the access throughput, access efficiency and access friendliness have been greatly improved.



##### 1.4.3 GR5526 vs GR5525

Compared with the GR5525, the GR5526 adds a more powerful Graphics module (2.5D GPU + Display Controller + 64 MB OSPI PSRAM), USB and PDM modules, and an SRAM space of 512 KB. It can design wearable products with more cool effect and higher resolution.



##### 1.4.4 General reference for type selection

| SoC    |Explain|
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GR551x |Resolution range generally recommended is < = 320 X 320|
| GR5525 |As an upgraded version of 551x, it supports software design with larger resolution and easier use. At present, the resolution of mass production can reach up to 454 X 454, without tearing and stuttering.|
| GR5526 |Both frame rate and effect can be considered. Better UX interactive experience can be designed based on 2.5D GPU. The frame rate can also be very high. The software is easy to use and simple to develop. It is recommended to choose medium and high resolution watches.|
