#### 1.1 Example Project

The GR5526 SDK provides a wealth of reference sample projects covering Bluetooth LE (Profile, Multi-Connect, DTM), peripheral usage, OS, DFU, low power, product reference designs, and more.

For wearable products, some important sample projects are listed; users can refer to the following sample projects to build all software modules of wearable products from scratch, from peripheral drivers to OS, application logic, Bluetooth LE Profile, DFU/OTA, sleep debugging, etc.

#### 1.2 Drive reference

The GR5526 SDK provides driver references for commonly used chip peripherals and peripheral modules. In product development, it can be referenced or reused according to the actual situation.

#### 1.3 LVGL GUI Framework Instructions

-   In the latest version of the GR5526 SDK (v1.0.2), two LVGL versions of the migration optimization are provided, and a reference project is provided respectively.
-   In general, it is recommended that users prefer to use LVGL version 8.3.1. From the point of view of porting and website support, the new version will have fewer bugs and better features.

### 2. Instructions for use of the migration

- This chapter is based on the description of the project **graphics_lvgl_831_gpu_demo_360p**, and the same is true of the project **graphics_lvgl_831_gpu_demo**.

   

#### 2.1 typical peripheral adaptation

- The sample project abstracts an Adapter layer from the screen control, touch processing and data Flash access involved in wearable products, and carries out a reference implementation. On the basis of the adaptation layer, users can re-adapt these types of peripherals according to the product conditions.

- By default, the function pointers of these types of peripherals are registered when the peripherals are initialized. For the sake of transplantation compatibility, the upper function interface is called as much as possible in the application layer.


  ```c
  void app_periph_init(void)
  {
      .....
      drv_adapter_disp_register();
      drv_adapter_norflash_register();
      drv_adapter_touchpad_register();
      .....
  }
  ```

  

##### 2.1.1 Adaptation of screen driver

- The screen adaptation layer abstracts the following function interfaces, and the user needs to implement the adaptation as required

  | 上层函数                        | 适配层函数(用户实现)     |Action|
  | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
  | drv_adapter_disp_register       | 如无必要,不用修改        |Registers an adaptation layer function|
  | drv_adapter_disp_init           | _disp_drv_init           |Screen initialization interface|
  | drv_adapter_disp_deinit         | _disp_drv_deinit         |Screen de-initialization interface|
  | drv_adapter_disp_set_show_area  | _disp_drv_set_show_area  |Set the screen display area|
  | drv_adapter_disp_wait_to_flush  | _disp_drv_wait_to_flush  | 等待刷屏, 必须等待上次刷屏完成 (一般使用信号量实现) |
  | drv_adapter_disp_flush          | _disp_drv_flush          |Flushes the framebuffer data to the screen for display|
  | drv_adapter_disp_wait_te        | _disp_drv_wait_te        |Wait for TE synchronization|
  | drv_adapter_disp_on             | _disp_drv_on             |Screen display on/off|
  | drv_adapter_disp_set_brightness | _disp_drv_set_brightness |Set the backlight brightness|
  | drv_adapter_disp_sleep          | _disp_drv_sleep          | 屏幕休眠, 对屏幕进行掉电,屏幕电路配置为最低功耗     |
  | drv_adapter_disp_wakeup         | _disp_drv_wakeup         | 屏幕唤醒, 配置屏幕电路及屏幕重新处于正常工作状态    |

- Users can refer to the prototype definition of the adaptation layer function and the driver of the sample project to implement the above interface functions in the driver file of the screen and improve the adaptation layer function.

- Note that the drv _ adapter _ disp _ set _ show _ area function sets the parameters for the display area as follows:

  - If the screen width and height are W and H, the input parameters are drv _ adapter _ disp _ set _ show _ area (0, 0, W-1, H-1);

- In the initial stage of adaptation, the three more important functions are as follows, which can be adapted to light the screen first, and then implement other interfaces.

  - Drv _ adapter _ disp _ init-includes Reset, backlight pin control, command timing initialization, etc., to ensure that the screen is ready to light up
  - Drv _ adapter _ disp _ set _ show _ area-Set the desired display area through the control command
  - Drv _ adapter _ disp _ flush — Refreshes the frame data to the screen for display



##### 2.1.2 Touch adaptation

The Touch adaptation layer abstracts the following function interfaces, and the user needs to implement the adaptation as required

| 上层函数                          | 适配层函数(用户实现)       |Action|
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| drv_adapter_touchpad_register     | 如无必要,不用修改          |Registers an adaptation layer function|
| drv_adapter_touchpad_init         | _touchpad_drv_init         |Touch initializes the interface|
| drv_adapter_touchpad_deinit       | _touchpad_drv_deinit       |Touch de-initialization interface|
| drv_adapter_touchpad_read_pointer | _touchpad_drv_read_pointer |Read Touch coordinate point function|
| drv_adapter_touchpad_sleep        | _touchpad_drv_sleep        | 设置Touch休眠, 根据产品设计, 进入休眠模式或直接掉电 |
| drv_adapter_touchpad_wakeup       | _touchpad_drv_wakeup       |Reset the Touch to wake-up mode|

- Users can refer to the prototype definition of the adaptation layer function and the driver of the sample project to implement the above interface functions in the driver file of Touch and improve the adaptation layer function.

- In general, the driver of Touch is mostly based on I2C interface, and the adaptation is relatively simple.

- If Touch uses interrupt wake-up IO (note that it is placed in the AON IO domain), consider waking up the system in the callback function of I/O (such as implementing semaphores).


  ```C
  /*
   * Override this function, defined as __weak in file drv_adapter_port_touchpad.c
   */
  void _touchpad_drv_irq_notify(void) {
      osal_sema_give(s_sleep_mgnt_sem);
  }
  ```

  

##### 2.1.3 Data Nor Flash Adaptation

- In general, the Nor Flash control commands of all manufacturers on the market are compatible, and there is no need to re-adapt the Nor Flash driver. However, the following situations need to be considered and the lower driver interface needs to be re-adapted:
  - The user may mount the Flash to a different QSPI module (it is mounted to QSPI0 by default), and needs to reconfigure the I/O of the Flash and modify the storage address of the picture material
  - There may be a few Flash models with differences in control commands from supported Flash vendors
  - The default driver does not support
- The external Nor Flash adaptation layer abstracts the following function interfaces, and the user needs to implement the adaptation as required

| 上层函数                           | 适配层函数(用户实现)        |Action|
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| drv_adapter_norflash_register      | 如无必要,不用修改           |Registers an adaptation layer function|
| drv_adapter_norflash_init          | _norflash_drv_init          |The flash initialization interface|
| drv_adapter_norflash_deinit        | _norflash_drv_deinit        |Anti-initialization interface of flash|
| drv_adapter_norflash_write         | _norflash_drv_write         |The interface for writing data of any length requires that the write address has been erased in advance, and the interface will not perform data backup of reading first and then writing.|
| drv_adapter_norflash_read          | _norflash_drv_read          |Read-arbitrary-length data interface|
| drv_adapter_norflash_update        | _norflash_drv_update        |When updating the data interface of any length, the operations of reading, backup, erasing and writing will be performed before updating, but the page erasing implementation is used for erasing. If the Flash used does not support the page erasing command. Requires re-adaptation|
| drv_adapter_norflash_erase         | _norflash_drv_erase         |Erasing interface, supporting Page, Sector, Block, Chip and other erasing modes|
| drv_adapter_norflash_set_mmap_mode | _norflash_drv_set_mmap_mode |Set MMAP access mode for Flash (on/off)|
| drv_adapter_norflash_sleep         | _norflash_drv_sleep         |Set the Flash to sleep|
| drv_adapter_norflash_wakeup        | _norflash_drv_wakeup        |Wake up Flash back to working state|

- If the external Flash on the circuit is not mounted on the QSPI0 module, modify **qspi_norf_init**the input ID and PIN pin configuration


  ```c
  #define NORFLASH_DEV_QSPI_ID                            APP_QSPI_ID_0                           /**< QSPI id to connect the norf */
  #define NORFLASH_DEV_CLOCK_PREESCALER                   2u                                      /**< clock prescaler for qspi */
  #define NORFLASH_DEV_PIN_CFG                            (g_qspi_pin_groups[QSPI0_PIN_GROUP_0])  /**< pin config for qspi */
  #define NORFLASH_DEV_DEV_ID                             0x0B                                    /**< 0x0B - XTX; 0x85 - PUYA */
  ```

- If Nor Flash is mounted to a non-QSPI0 module, the storage location of the resource image also needs to be adjusted. The default base address of the Lvgl image resource generated by the tool in accordance with the GPU version is placed in the MMAP space **QSPI0_XIP_BASE**of QSPI0. As follows (file lv _ IMG _ DSC _ list. C):


  ```
  #if USE_EXTERNAL_RESOURCES
  #define BINARY_RESOURCES (const uint8_t *)QSPI0_XIP_BASE
  #else
  extern const uint8_t BINARY_RESOURCES[];
  #endif // USE_EXTERNAL_RESOURCES
  
  const lv_img_dsc_t wd_img_black_clock_face = {
      .header.always_zero = 0,
      .header.cf = LV_IMG_CF_GDX_RGB565,
      .header.w = 360,
      .header.h = 360,
      .data_size = 259200,
      .data = BINARY_RESOURCES + OFFSET_BLACK_CLOCK_FACE,
  };
  ```

  - If you change to a QSPI1-mounted Flash, the base address is set to **QSPI1_XIP_BASE**, and so on
  - If the storage address of the image resource does not start from the 0 address of Flash, you need to add a specific offset.



#### 2.2 Lvgl related

##### 2.2.1 Resolution Configuration

- The user can configure the resolution to the actual resolution of the product screen through the following macro configuration of the lv _ conf. H:


    ```c
    #ifndef DISP_HOR_RES
        #define DISP_HOR_RES                454u
    #endif
    
    #ifndef DISP_VER_RES
        #define DISP_VER_RES                454u
    #endif
    
    #define DISP_PIXEL_DEPTH            2u
    ```

- The screen resolution width/height is defined by the DISP _ VER _ RES DISP _ HOR _ RES respectively. The default definition is 454x454, and the custom macro value is defined in the predefined macro of the keil configuration item (located in the menu: Project-> Options for target-> C/C + +-> Define).

- To support GPU cutscenes, define the width and height of the resolution as even. (If one side of the screen is odd, you can define more or less rows/columns.)

- 2 bytes for the definition of the pixel depth, i.e. the selected format RGB 565. This format is already applicable to most of the current display product scenarios and does not need to be modified.

- The format of the frame buffer is defined in the following functions:


    ```c
    uint32_t lv_port_get_fb_format(void) {
    #if DISP_PIXEL_DEPTH == 2
        return HAL_GFX_RGB565;
    #elif DISP_PIXEL_DEPTH == 4
        return HAL_GFX_RGBA8888;
    #else
        #error "Not Support Now"
    #endif
    }
    ```



##### 2.2.2 Color configuration

- The drawing layer of Lvgl itself has been optimized and adapted based on the GPU of 5526. The default configuration of the color format is as follows, which is not recommended to be modified:


  ```c
  #define LV_COLOR_DEPTH 32
  ```

  - The color depth is defined as 32 in lv _ conf. H. Please do not modify it. Based on this color depth configuration, the image has been adapted and compatible with RGB565, RGBA8888, TSC4, TSC6a and other formats, and has the maximum compatibility with the image source format.

- When using custom colors in your code, use the lv _ color _ make interface instead of the lv _ color _ hex interface. The former is matched in endorder.



##### 2.2.3 Frame Buffer

- Lvgl frame render buffer:

  - In the reference example, the software architecture of the double frame buffer is used to facilitate the parallel execution of rendering and screen brushing tasks to improve the frame rate. Please do not modify the architecture of the double buffer. RGB565 used for the pixel format of the frame render buffer
  - The code to allocate a double buffer is as follows:


  ```c
  void lv_port_disp_init(void)
  {
      /*-------------------------
       * Initialize your display
       * -----------------------*/
      disp_init();
  
      /*-----------------------------
       * Create two fixed frame buffers for drawing and never release it
       *----------------------------*/
      static lv_disp_draw_buf_t draw_buf_dsc;
  
      lv_color_t* _draw_buf1 = app_graphics_mem_malloc(DISP_HOR_RES * DISP_VER_RES * DISP_PIXEL_DEPTH);
      lv_color_t* _draw_buf2 = app_graphics_mem_malloc(DISP_HOR_RES * DISP_VER_RES * DISP_PIXEL_DEPTH);
      ....
   }
  ```

- Frame pass animation buffer:

  - In the process of window switching, in order to speed up the animation rendering and improve the frame rate, two additional frame animation buffers are applied, and the pixel format used in the frame animation rendering buffer is TSC4. The code is as follows:


    ```c

- In case of frame rendering exception, buffer data debugging is required, and the first address of the buffer can be obtained from the above code location.



##### 2.2.4 Definition of frame format

- The configurations covered in this section do not need to be modified by default

- There are two places to define the frame format in the project:

  - When the GPU renders, it is necessary to inform the GPU of the format of the frame buffer. The default configuration is **HAL_GFX_RGB565**. The code is as follows:


    ```
    uint32_t lv_port_get_fb_format(void) {
    #if DISP_PIXEL_DEPTH == 2
        return HAL_GFX_RGB565;
    #elif DISP_PIXEL_DEPTH == 4
        return HAL_GFX_RGBA8888;
    #else
        #error "Not Support Now"
    #endif
    }
    ```

  - When the DC (Display Controller) refreshes the screen, it is necessary to inform the DC module of the format of the frame buffer. The configuration location is at the screen refreshing interface, which is transmitted through the buf _ format variable. The two DC frame formats currently used globally are as follows

    - HAL _ GDC _ RGB565-The format specified for the DC module when the screen is refreshed with the standard rendering frame buffer
    - HAL _ GDC _ TSC4-The format specified for the DC module when using the frame pass animation buffer to refresh the screen


    ```c
    void graphics_dc_st77916_flush(void *buf, uint32_t buf_format, uint16_t w, uint16_t h)
    {
        app_graphics_dc_cmd_t dc_cmd = {
            .command = ST77916_INST_WR_I1A4D4,
            .address = 0x002C00,
            .address_width = GDC_FRAME_ADDRESS_WIDTH_24BIT,
            .frame_timing = GDC_QSPI_FRAME_TIMING_1,
        };
    
        app_graphics_dc_framelayer_t dc_layer = {
            .frame_baseaddr = buf,
            .resolution_x = w,
            .resolution_y = h,
            .row_stride = -1,
            .start_x = 0,
            .start_y = 0,
            .size_x = w,
            .size_y = h,
            .alpha = 0,
            .blendmode = HAL_GDC_BL_SRC,
            .data_format = (graphics_dc_data_format_e)buf_format,
        };
    
        app_graphics_dc_send_single_frame(GRAPHICS_DC_LAYER_0, &dc_layer, &dc_cmd, GDC_ACCESS_TYPE_ASYNC);
    }
    ```
    
    - Be careful not to mix up that enumeration value when specifying frame format for the GPU and DC



#### 2.3 User Task Description

- The sample project newly defines three user-level tasks:
  - GUI Task-Rendering for Lvgl tasks. Lvgl tasks are not thread safe and cannot call the drawing class interface asynchronously.
  - Touch Task-used to collect Touch events and process the events for GUI tasks
  - Event Task-currently used to send Key events to Lvgl Task for execution through the Lvgl asynchronous interface
