## Software problems caused by hardware circuit



### 1. External Flash access exception caused by GR5526 SK dialing error

-   Q: When GR5526 SK is used for the function test of external Flash, for example, the external Flash is used in the firmware cache space of DFU OTA, occasionally there is a data reading verification error, and the software finds no abnormality.
-   A: The two types of Flash normally configured for GR5526 SK are XT25Q64D and P25Q128L, both of which are low-voltage Flash with 1.65V ~ 2V power supply. After eliminating the possibility of software abnormality, pay attention to check the position of the GR5526 SK S1 dial switch to see if the 5/6 pin is connected. If the 5/6 pin is connected, VDDIO uses 3.3 V power supply. Need to switch to 4/5 pin connection, change to use 1.8 V VIO _ LDO _ OUT power supply.



### 2. Reverse color flicker on the screen when the GR5526 SK is running Watch Demo

-   The phenomenon is shown in the figure below. The reason is similar to the first problem. The screen VDDIO needs to use 1.8 V power supply. Switch the S1 dial switch to 4/5 pin connection.
